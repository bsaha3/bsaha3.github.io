We are looking for UT students from diverse backgrounds with skills in information science, computer science, and medical science, to leverage their collective knowledge as a team and create an app for mining large datasets of electronic medical records. The app should produce valuable knowledge to support clinical decision making and present it through an effortless, immediate interface.\nHow to access the data\nThe challenge is based on the MIMIC-III database. All participants must use this dataset. There is a formal process for requesting access to MIMIC-III found here: https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/. You will need to pass the Human Subject Online Course from MIT in order to get permission to download the dataset. This process can take several days, so plan accordingly. Participants must agree to the MIMIC-III data use agreement. Please submit the completion report (not the certificate).\nHow to submit the deliverables\nPlease submit the following items before 11PM Central Time March 2 nd , 2020 to XYZ email:\n● A 2-5 page report on the details of how you built the app. This report should contain the link to your GitHub, the details of your methods, and screenshots of your app.\n● 5-minute video about your process.\nFinalists will be announced on April 2, 2020. They will present their apps to a panel of health care experts on May 1, 2020, who will choose the winner at the end of the day.\nTo participate and connect with potential teammates, register by filling in this google form XYZ before Dec 1, 2019.\nHow to win\nYour submission will be shortlisted by UT Austin faculty by March 22, 2020. The top teams will be invited to participate in a day-long seminar on April 3, 2020, where each team will present their work to a jury of healthcare professionals.\nThe judging criteria are:\n● Usability\n● Novelty\n● Reproducibility\nWhat you’ll win\n1st prize: $1500; 2nd prize: $500\nThe two winning submissions will be made available on the AI Health website.\nDeadlines\n● Register at XYZ google form by December 1, 2019\n● Final submission due by 11pm CST on March 2, 2020\n● Announcement of finalists: March 22, 2020\n● Presentation and judging: April 3, 2020\n","date":1575248188,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575248188,"objectID":"50c57db7d5cb0566523395b27fcc4a93","permalink":"/publication/ai-health-data-challenge/","publishdate":"2019-09-22T19:56:28-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ai-health-data-challenge/","section":"publication","summary":"Big changes are on the horizon for all of healthcare.

Policies that target only new users may therefore be especially promising. Using commercial insurance claims data, we provide the first evidence on a set of new policies intended to reduce opioid initiation in the form of limits on initial prescription length. We also provide the first evidence on the impact of must-access prescription drug monitoring programs (MA-PDMPs), laws that do not target new users, on initial opioid use. Although initial limit policies reduce the average length of initial prescriptions, they do so primarily by raising the frequency of short prescriptions, resulting in increases in opioids dispensed to new users. In contrast, we find that MA-PDMPs reduce opioids dispensed to new users, even though they do not explicitly set out to do so. Neither policy significantly affects extreme use such as doctor shopping among new patients, because such behavior is very rare.
